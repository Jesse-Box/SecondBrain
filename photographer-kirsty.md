## Transcription

- Kirsty: Yeah, I've always been into mobile photography because I've had a smartphone for quite a while. You know, being half Asian, I'm always taking photos.
- Kirsty: Yeah, I started taking pictures before, but I never sold them I mainly took pictures for pleasure. I use [[Instagram]], and I was a user of EyeEm before I started working there. When I joined at EyeEm as a Product Manager in 2014, we didn't have the marketplace, just a community. We spent the next years building the marketplace, EyeEm Awards and how to handle enterprise clients. In general, I was mostly focused on the web team building both the buyer and seller side, so as you can imagine, it was very two-sided. I worked quite a lot with Nicholas's team by building the [[Inspector]] tool. Is it still called that? Yeah, so we put a lot of work into how EyeEm processes pictures, but mostly my job was focused on the customer-facing part. Enterprise didn't exist at that stage, the assumption was like, "okay, consumers will buy one type of photo, and they can choose from three levels of pricing".
- Jesse: So by the time you left EyeEm, was the experience similar to what it is today?
- Kirsty: Yeah in some ways, most of the [[Upload]] traffic was still on mobile, and during that time we built the web uploader. However, as far as I can tell, our web upload experience was pretty basic. You could add some tags, and then that was it.
- Jesse: Have your habits changed, moving on from EyeEm?
- Kirsty: Yeah, I guess, I take fewer photos, and I definitely don't do [[Release]]s anymore. At EyeEm, it was super easy to sort out my releases because we were all taking photos of each other.
- Jesse: And do you have a specific idea of what to shoot? Or do decide at the moment?
- Kirsty: I don't have any plan for what I want to shoot. It's rare, but on occasion when taking pictures of my friends, I take a close-up of their hands because I know, without a [[Release]] it can sell quickly. I definitely wouldn't walk around the city with the purpose to sell photos. Instead, the idea to sell comes to me when I scroll through my camera roll, and the thought comes that selling this or that photo is possible.
- Jesse: How do you know that's like something with hands will sell more? Is that expert knowledge you've learnt from EyeEm?
- Kirsty: I just know that you can sell those types of photos without a [[Release]]. I know the rules around model and property releases from working at EyeEm.
- Jesse: I know you use [[Twenty20]] as a place to sell photos, but do you use any other similar services?
- Kirsty: I also use [[Shutterstock]] and EyeEm. I don't really use any on any other platforms. I rely on EyeEm to send my photos to [[Getty Images]].
- Jesse: Using those three services as an example, how would you define a good seller experience?
- Kirsty: I think it's a comfortable [[Upload]] experience. One of the best thing about EyeEm is that you don't have to manually [[Keyword]] your photos, the suggestions aren't perfect, but it's good enough. I'm not precious when it comes to keywording my photos, I recognise that some people are, but I'm not one of them. [[Keyword]] suggestions are the big thing that sets EyeEm apart from the rest. I think [[Twenty20]] has begun testing keyword suggestions in their upload experience and [[Shutterstock]] have always had them; however, the recommendations aren't great.
- I definitely feel like my experience at EyeEm leads me to think that my keywording will be taken cared of, while Shutterstock it's solely my responsibility. In general, [[Shutterstock]] feels like more effort because I have to be more considerate of my keywords. [[Twenty20]] is a lot better by comparison, at the end of the [[Upload]] flow they ask you to identify models, which mitigates some of the work done on [[Inspector]]. How accurate it is, I don't know. Still, I can imagine most people probably just proceed through without checking the photos.
- Jesse: Are there any other features that you feel is necessary for good user experience?
- Kirsty: [[Twenty20]] doesn't have an editing step in their upload flow, so in a way the process is more straightforward then what EyeEm has, you just upload the finished photo. Comparing Twenty20 and EyeEm, I think the [[Upload]] processes themselves are relatively similar. Moving away from the upload experience, one thing I like about Twenty20 is that when you sell a photo, you always get a [[Notification]]. Getting those regular notifications is a little moment of joy. Twenty20 spreads out those notifications over the month, unlike EyeEm, which sends all emails at the end of the month.
- Kirsty: Getting fairly regular congratulation emails are nice, and it encourages me to engage with the product more frequently. Yeah, and then, the topic of [[Earnings]], everyone likes to the platform where they make the most money. Doesn't really matter how hard the process is to sell if it means more money at the end of the day. Since [[Envato]] acquired Twenty20, I actually make more [[Earnings]]. They aren't transparent how I make money, but at the end of the day, I don't really care. So I'm actually making more from Twenty20, even though my [[Upload]] rate for EyeEm & Twenty20 is about the same.
- Kirsty: The reason why I sell more stuff is that you can sell photos under an [[Editorial]] license. This means you can just [[Upload]] photos without worrying about releases. On Twenty20 I upload little to no photos with releases, it's been like that for years now. I guess that that's pretty nice.
- Jesse: So just be clear the [[Payouts]] money you earn is higher on Twenty20 than Twenty20?
- Kirsty: Yeah, on a month to month basis, I would say so, but maybe it has to do with the type of photos I'm selling.
- Kirsty: On the topic of [[Performance]]; I'm not sure because the servers are based in Europe, but EyeEm's app seems slow when compared with EyeEm. Australian internet isn't great, but sometimes I feel like I'm waiting for so long for my feed to load. Can be very off-putting for me.
- Kirsty: I don't know if people are aware of that, because EyeEm probably doesn't have heaps of Australians providing feedback. I did notice it when I moved here, I was like, "Oh my God, why is it so slow?". Probably has something to do with my internet but also EyeEm's servers.
- Jesse: Since you've contributed to the [[Inspector]] tool, you understand how it works but as a user, how would you describe in your own experience with the approval process?
- Kirsty: I see a lot of my photos as [[Selected]] which sucks because I know that it's been [[Rejected]], however normal users probably wouldn't understand that. When I contributed to the [[Inspector]] tool, the way the process worked was if the photo is [[Selected]] and then rejected, we still just show selected to the user. So while I might understand that my photo has been [[Rejected]], an average user might think the queue for approval is just really long.
- Kirsty: Would be nice to show why a photo is [[Rejected]] and with some details, for example; Is it too small? Did I miss a logo? Then again re-[[Upload]]ing photos is painful as well because I can't be bothered hunting for the photo in my camera roll. Even as a super-user I wouldn't re-[[Upload]], because I don't need the 20 cents from [[Getty Images]].
- Jesse: How would you compare the EyeEm experience with [[Twenty20]]?
- Kirsty: I don't think they even have a [[Market Status]], at the end of their flow it just says "pending review". All my recent Twenty20 photos are pending review actually, and I uploaded them at the end of June, which is well over a month ago. They're still [[Pending Review]], oh my god... So I have photos from April which have been approved, which means a backlog of a couple of months shows. I would rarely check, though.
- Jesse: Just so I understand you're on your phone right now and your viewing a list of photos from your [[User Profile]]?
- Kirsty: Yes. Okay, opening up one of my photos, [[Twenty20]] tells you the date it was uploaded, and whether it's been reviewed. I think if it's for an [[Editorial]] photo, it's automatically approved. I think during the upload flow, an "editorial" photo will skip the review process which is primarily meant for [[Commercial]] photos. That's why it feels faster probably because uploading editorial photos is easy and on sale immediately.
- Jesse: So EyeEm recently ran an NPS survey, and we received a quite a few feedback points, would you mind if we went through each point?
- Kirsty: Sure
- Jesse: Photos are sorted [[Chronological]]ly, and it's hard to find the best of.
- Kirsty: Yeah, I would agree with that, but it's also a standard experience across every platform. I don't know, any platform, which sorts it by "[[Top Sellers]]". The one nice feature of Twenty20 is that you have a separate section showing all the photos you've sold or have won or have done well in missions. This is in a limited sense a "[[Top Sellers]]". Occasionally I would look through there to see what my best sellers are. Still, they're chronologically ordered. I would like to see what photos haven't sold, because I just want to [[Delete]] them from my profile. The more photos you have, the more you have to manage and the more of a footprint you're leaving. If I can just keep my [[User Profile]] to 200 really good selling photos that will be much nicer. I've got photos which I probably uploaded three years ago and never been bought. Might as well take them down, but there's no way to identify them.
- Jesse: All right. Next one. Photos are unstructured, and it's hard to find all photos of one theme.
- Kirsty: Yeah, that's probably true. However, this is not something that I care about. I'll just take photos of anything not caring about sorting them into [[Collection]]s.
- Jesse: Yes. So you don't use Twenty20's [[Collection]] feature?
- Kirsty: No
- Jesse: Next one: I need to scroll through my feed for ages to find a specific photo.
- Kirsty: Yeah, I would agree with that, but again that's also the same for all platforms. I guess it depends on why you're looking for the photo, or if there was another way to find it. Yeah because I know EyeEm [[Search]] pretty well I've learnt how to "hack" it. So for example, if I uploaded a photo which tagged Peter in the photo, I would search for my username and the word "Peter".
- Jesse: Moving on. The [[Market Status]] for [[Commercial]] photos are confusing, and the overview of market photos are unstructured.
- Kirsty: Yeah, the [[Market Status]] is definitely confusing — already mentioned that. It's confusing if the photos just stay in limbo and you have no idea what's happened to it. EyeEm is different from Twenty20 in that sense that it's both a [[Photography Community]] and a marketplace, whereas Twenty20 is just a marketplace. So you don't have a split between all my photos and my market photos but, they're still unstructured meaning they are organised [[Chronological]]ly.
- Jesse: So there's no way to easily see what photo's still need to be reviewed or what's on the market?
- Kirsty: Yeah, you can only see, your photos, videos, collections, or like photos. Yeah, liked photos and then there is that separate list of what you've sold.
- Jesse: All right. Next one is lack of [[Seller Stats]].
- Kirsty: That was always a topic that came up when I was still at EyeEm. Yet, we never validated whether everybody wanted it. For me personally, I do want to see what my best sellers are. Twenty20 experience is very similar to EyeEm [[Payouts]] page. So if you wanted to know what sells well, you would have to open up each month and look at each sold photo.
- Kirsty: Yeah, I can understand why people don't build these features, though. It might bring you more revenue indirectly, but if people can understand what sells, they might upload more of it. It's hard to measure.
- Jesse: And the last one is that it's time-consuming to delete photos.
- Kirsty: Yeah, also correct. At the same time, providing someone with great deletion experience isn't gonna make EyeEm any money. Maybe its good to not make it so easy for users to [[Delete]] their photos having said that, I would want to delete photos which are not performing well. So maybe you don't lose any revenue from it, and you actually make users happy.
- Kirsty: I guess you could say that EyeEm has an incentive to clean up bad photos because you know, every lousy leaf or flower photo that's on someone's profile could show up in [[Search]]. Buyers might find this annoying.
- Jesse: Okay so we covered the critical points from the survey, is there any last words you would like to say?
- Kirsty: I think the thing which EyeEm has always had going for itself is the [[Photography Community]]. If you lose that, you're basically the same as every other platform.
